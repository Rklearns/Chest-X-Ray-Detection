# Chest-X-Ray-Detection
These are models made to detect whether a person has pneumonia or not using various image based techniques
#CNN Technique
Acquired an accuracy of 92 percent with very good results in precision recall accuracy and F1 score
inititally I was finding it difficult as my model was overfitting then I found out about techniques like dropout,L2,early stop,etc that can overcome the overfitting problem.
#Resnet
Acquired an accuracy of 85 percent , I used imagenet as weight for this pretrained model 
I tried out with freezing and unfreezing of layers to fine tune as well to get better accuracy.
i think this model still has potential to have better accuracy by applying better data augmentation and exploring more techniques.
#Since this was an imbalanced dataset data augmentation had to be done in CNN to acquire a good accuracy
